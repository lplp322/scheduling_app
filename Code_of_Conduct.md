On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)? What standards must the work submitted meet?

We co-create our documents on Google docs but we integrate it along with Gitlab and communicate through WhatsApp group except for the (online) meetings which are conducted on the Discord. When it comes to the standards of the work, it needs to be approved by multiple team members.

**Planning:**

How do you ensure that each group member finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submits it to Brightspace *on behalf of the project group?*

We will distribute the tasks equally, based on our time estimations that are posted together with the issues on GitLab. At first each person chooses which issues they want to resolve and if multiple people pick up the same issue, they can both contribute, or one of them could choose to solve another issue. Any leftover issues will be picked up by whoever already got their issues done. We will work with the Gitlab milestone feature to make sure that work is done in time and that we keep on track for the final result. 

We will make sure to set deadlines so that everyone knows when they have to be done with certain parts. We will also put everything that we need to do on Trello, so that it is all stored in one place. If people are stuck at certain points, they can ask other group members and if they also don’t know, they can go to the TA’s to make sure they aren’t stuck for too long. Everyone in our group should be happy with the final product, which is why everyone should have a say in the final project. 

**Behavior:**

How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?

We try to treat each other with patience and we aim for a friendly working environment, as this would bring the most productivity out of every member of the group. We also acknowledge the fact that each one of us might have more knowledge regarding some subjects, and we all try to learn from each other. We handle our disagreements maturely, by discussing all the possibilities and views before taking a decision, and we try to make our decisions by finding a common denominator that we all can agree on. Our student assistant could guide us if we cannot reach an agreement on behalf of ourselves, or if there is still some confusion. We try to message the person that is late and see what is happening, and if they notice that they will be late for a couple of minutes we will wait for them, otherwise we will go on with our meeting and afterwards quickly brief him on what was discussed.

**Communication:**

In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? (in the studio/MS Teams/Miro/Discourse)

We have a Whatsapp group chat for communication during the week. The online meeting we do via a Discord-call. When doing a meeting in person we meet on campus. We communicate with our TA via Mattermost.

**Meetings:**

How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings?

Once or twice a week outside of the mandatory meetings, to discuss the work each of us did and to work together on the assignments. We meet whenever we feel we have a few things we must discuss. We like to meet on tuesday as this is the deadline for the work we want the TA to review. We cancel or postpone our meeting if too many members can’t show up.

**Decision-making:**

How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?

Consensus, as it is not that hard to find an agreement. If there is still one person who disagrees, we will try to explain our reasoning and why we went with a certain decision, and if he still does not want to accept our decision, he has to comply, otherwise we will contact our TA.

**Dealing with conflicts:**

How do you handle conflicts within the group?

We try to be as transparent as possible with each other and discuss everything as a group, we try to be more than just the sum of our parts. If there exists a conflict we try to manage it as a group and we try to function well together, if something rises up it needs to be addressed in a group meeting as soon as possible, as any lasting conflict would damage the working environment of the other team members that are not involved.

**Guidance:**

What do you expect from the teacher's and/or student assistant’s guidance? What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?

We expect that the TA’s and teacher’s will answer our questions or guide us to the correct answer if we are stuck.  We would like feedback on the work we upload and also on our weekly progress. We will push our work to main on Tuesday so that the TA has time to review the work.

**Consequences:**

What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements?

We first try to tell him politely what he is not doing, what would be expected from all the other team members, and we would try to help him manage if there are any problems. If we do not succeed on our own we would ask for help from our TA.

**Success factors:**

What makes your team a dream team?

Hard work and good efficient communication between all the team members. A person can achieve a lot individually, but what a well connected team can achieve is much more impressive, as there is no I in team :D
